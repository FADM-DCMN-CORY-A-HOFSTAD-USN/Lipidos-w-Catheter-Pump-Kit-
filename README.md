Lípidos Organic Plant-Based Sterile Cerebrospinal Fluid [CSF] by VirusT


Lípidos Supports Survivors With Damaged Prostates
The prostate is responsible for producing the body's lipid capsules. Lipid capsules are the vessel of life for any-and-all chemicals and minerals in the body. The prostate pumps lipids against gravity into the spine, internal organs, and brain. Along the spine, channels carry lipids into internal organs to become bodily fluids. Lipid capsules carry waste away from bones and tissues.
Lipid capsules fill the spine as spinal fluid.
Lipid capsules fill the skull.
Lipid capsules filled with Iron make up red blood cells [hemoglobins].
Lipid capsules filled with Zinc make up white blood cells [plasma].
Lipid capsules filled with sperm cells make up semen.
Lipid capsules filled with protein make up breast milk.
Lípidos Delivers Strong Sterile Lipid Capsules, Vitamins, and Pure Hydration
Lípidos is an FDA-approved plant-based medical clinical formula for use with a catheter pump. Lipidos is an organic farm-to-clinic sterile product used to support those with damaged prostates. VirusTC provides Lípidos during the treatment of prostate cancer. VirusTC does not recommend the removal of the prostate. A human cannot exist without a prostate. Lípidos supports healthy bodily functions during the processes of pathology used to remove pycnogonids from male or female prostate glands.


Lípidos is a mild cancer medication with the primary function of replacing lipid capsules and spinal fluid vitamins lost to prostate cancer. Lípidos is sterile and provides alkaline antiviral medication to support a clean healthy spinal column, brain cavity, and internal organ tract. Lípidos provides lipid capsules for many bodily fluids including blood, plasma, spine, and brain fluid.


Lipid capsules that match the shape of human lipid capsules have been found in an organic blue corn species. The "grit" portion of the corn kernel contains high concentrations of lipids to supply the kernel germ's development into a new corn plant. The grit is harvested, and the rest of the corn goes into various food products that VirusTC is invested in. The grit contains an organic glue that is broken down by organic proprietary plant-based compounds.
